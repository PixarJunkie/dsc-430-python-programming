last_letter_count()

#Observations: Out of the 2 thousand names looked at; last letters of girl names appear to use less of the alphabet than boys since there were a lot more 0 counts among girl names than boys. Both boys and girls had more frequent uses of the letters e and n than any of the other letters in the alphabet.The least commonly used letters among both boys and girls were f, j, u, and q (all were either 1 or 0)
