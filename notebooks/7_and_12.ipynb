    "Consider this game.  The user begins with an account value of $100.  She may place a bet of an amount of her choosing, but not more than her current balance.  She then rolls two six-sided dice.  Her score is the sum of the faces of the dice.  If she rolls a 7 or a 12 she wins and doubles her bet.  If she does not roll a 7 or 12, she has the option to double her bet and roll a third die.  If all three dice sum to 7 or 12 she wins three times the total value of her bet.\n",
